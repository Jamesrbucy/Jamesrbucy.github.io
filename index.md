## DAY 1: Code 102 Intro

_**Growth Mindset**_

Having a growth mindset is all about not being your own worst enemy. Every coder comes across points in their career which causes them to question themselves and if you cant keep a growth mindset, you may burn out. Here are some examples to stay in that positive state of mind.

1. Don't say to yourself I cant do this, say I cant do this _yet!_
1. Don't be concerned that someone knows more than you, realize that everyone went through what you are.
    1. And every coder still has more to learn!
1. Don't be afraid of a challenge!
    1. Like coding, every challenge will have many ways to solve them, but not trying will never fix anything.
