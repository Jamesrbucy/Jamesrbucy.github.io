## DAY 1: Code 102 Intro

_**Growth Mindset**_

Having a growth mindset is all about not being your own worst enemy. Every coder comes across points in their career which causes them to question themselves and if you cant keep a growth mindset, you may burn out. Here are some examples to stay in that positive state of mind.

1. Dont say to yourself I cant do this, say I cant do this _yet!_
1. Dont be concerned that someone knows more than you, realize that everyone went through what you are.
    1. And every coder still has more to learn!
1. Dont be afraid of a challenge!
    1. like coding, every challenge will have many ways to solve them, but not trying will never fix anything.

## DAY 2: Text editors, Terminals, Shortcuts

_**Text Editors**_

Text editors are the programs which you write your code in a language that computers can understand. Many different developers use different text editors to code, and people often wonder which program is considered "best". While some may seem better than others, many are very similar  to one another. Some of the more important features to look for in a 

1. Code Completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. Choice of themes
4. Availabilty of extensions for the program

_**The Command Line**_

_The command line_, or the terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. These commands include, finding, opening, and changing files on your computer, and much more. Their are so many different commands available to perform on the command line that knowing shortcuts can make manuevering this system much simpler. Here is a chart of few shortcuts to help when first getting accustomed to the command line.

| Shortcut Commands | Command Definition            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| pwd               | Displays Current Directory    |
| ls                | Displays context of directory |
