_**New Languages**_

A full day to learn today, in fact almost to much to fit on this page, but i will try and summarize as specifically as I can. The languages we worked with today were html, css, and javascript.

**HTML**
* HTMl is your basic coding language for text
* orders and structure the text for your site
* seperates your text into group and sections
* has some stylization such as Headers and lists, but very minimal

**CSS**
* Stylization language
* moves, shapes, sizes, and contours images and texts on the site
* Stylizes the color and look of your site
* positions all the information
* makes sites much more engaging to look at

**Javascript**
* work language
* used for adding variables and changing information
* makes chunks of code that can be repeatable
* helps create more engaging and interactive web pages
